# Simple React Chess

- A simple in-browser chess board with no move validation
- Useful if you want to demo a certain position without having to make legal moves to get there
- Inspired by https://www.techighness.com/post/develop-two-player-chess-game-with-react-js/
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
